# NgOnepage

A simple Angular starting point for onepagers.

## Package manager

In this project we use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage the node modules. If you rather use good 'ole [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), you need to change some things in the package.json and use `npm install` instead of `yarn`.
